# SpecialBinaryTree
ask the User for some input text – you should validate that the User has not inputted empty text. We will be building a tree based on this input such that: • Every unique character in the input text will be a leaf node (i.e., the number of leaves will be equal to the number of unique characters). • Every node that is not the root and is not a leaf will be some text containing some of the characters, such that each character appears just once. • The root node will be some text containing each of the unique characters in the input string such that each character appears once and only once. • Additionally, not just will each node contain some text (even if it is just one character) – which can be thought of as the data of the node, but also each node will be associated with a numeric weight which is calculated.
